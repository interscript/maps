    The United Nations recommended system was approved in 1972 (II/11) and amended in 1977 (III/12),
    based on a report prepared by D. N. Sharma. The tables and their corrections were published in volume
    II of the conference reports1,2.

    There is no evidence of the use of the system either in India or in international cartographic products.

    Punjabi (Panjābī) in India uses an alphasyllabic script (Gurmukhi) whereby each character represents a syllable
    rather than one sound. Vowels and diphthongs are marked in two ways: as independent characters (used syllable-initially)
    and in an abbreviated form, to denote vowels after consonants. The romanization table is unambiguous. The system is mostly
    reversible but there exist some ambiguities in the romanization of vowels (independent vs. abbreviated characters) and
    consonants (combinations with subscript consonants vs. character sequences).
