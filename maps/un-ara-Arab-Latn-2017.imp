  description: |
    The current United Nations recommended romanization
    system was approved in 2017 (resolution XI/3), based on
    the system adopted by Arabic experts at the conference
    held in Beirut in 2007, the Unified Arabic
    Transliteration System, taking into account the
    practical amendments and corrections carried out and
    agreed upon by the representatives of the Arabic-
    speaking countries at the Fourth Arab Conference on
    Geographical Names, held in Beirut in 2008, and some
    clarifications and amendments agreed in Riyadh in 20171.
    Previously, the United Nations had approved a
    romanization system in 1972 (resolution II/8), based on the
    system adopted by Arabic experts at the conference
    held at Beirut in 1971 with the practical amendments carried out
    and agreed upon by the representatives of the Arabic-speaking
    countries at their conference. The table was published in volume
    II of the conference report.
    In UN resolution XI/3 it is specifically stated that the
    system was recommended for the “romanization of the
    geographical names within those Arabic-speaking countries
    where this system is officially adopted”. There is
    evidence of its partial implementation in Jordan, Oman and
    Saudi Arabia. The UNGEGN Working Group on Romanization
    Systems intends to continue monitoring the UN system’s
    implementation across Arabic-speaking countries.
    In some countries there exist local romanization schemes
    or practices. The geographical names of Algeria, Djibouti,
    Mauritania, Morocco and Tunisia are generally rendered in
    the traditional manner which conforms to the principles of
    the French orthography.
    The previous UN-approved system is still found in
    considerable international usage.
    Arabic is written from right to left. The Arabic script
    usually omits vowel points and diacritical marks from
    writing which makes it difficult to obtain uniform results
    in the romanization of Arabic. It is essential to identify
    correctly the words which appear in any particular name
    and to know the standard Arabic-script spelling including
    the relevant vowels. One must also take into account
    dialectal and idiosyncratic deviations. The romanization
    is generally reversible though there may be some ambiguous
    letter sequences (dh, kh, sh, th) which may also point to
    combinations of Arabic characters in addition to the
    respective single characters.
  notes:
    - |
      When the definite article al precedes a word beginning with
      one of the "sun letters" (t, th, d, dh, r, z, s, sh, s̱, ḏ, ṯ,
      d͟h, l, n) the l of the definite article is assimilated with
      the first consonant of the word: الشارقة Ash Shāriqah.
    - |
      The definite article is always written with a capital
      initial: الزيتون Az Zaytūn, البلد Al Balad, منية الضنية Minyat Aḏ
      Ḏinniyyah.
    - |
      Nunation is unlikely to be found in geographical names and
      the last letter remains silent: جبل = جبلٌ Jabal (not Jabalun).
    - |
      In order to disambiguate certain character sequences a
      middle dot (·) may be used: سهيلة S·haylah (cf. شيلة Shaylah), دهيب
      D·hayb (cf. ذيب Dhayb), أدهم Ad·ham (cf. أذم Adham).
    - |
      ta' marboota should be transliterated to 'ah' if it's in
      a definite article, or at the end of the sentence
      otherwise it should be transliterated to 'at'
      to handle words starting with AL and ending with ta' marboota
      which is pronounced as "ah" not "at" divided into multiple
      regex because lookbehind in ruby doesn't support variable length
    - |
      مَكّة should be transliterated to makkah, shadda above ك
      is to double the consonant, same applies to all arabic letters
