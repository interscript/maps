# This map has been partially converted by the bin/maps_v1_to_v2 script
# The section below requires human attention. Remember to remove this
# comment and move the converted map to 'maps/' directory. Please also
# take note that the maps-staging directory will be cleaned up whenever
# you run the bin/maps_v1_to_v2 script. You should particularly be
# concerned about any regular expressions found in this file and about
# advanced expressions in parallel {} parts, and also about the order
# of particular parts of the stage.
