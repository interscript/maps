  description: |
    The United Nations recommended system was approved in 1972 (II/11)
    and amended in 1977 (III/12), based on a report prepared by D. N.
    Sharma. The tables and their corrections were published in volume II of
    the conference reports1,2.

    There is no evidence of the use of the system either in Bangladesh,
    in India or in international cartographic products. The resolution
    IV/17 (1982) recommended association, inter alia, with Bangladesh, in
    carrying out further studies on the system.

    Bengali (Bānglā) uses an alphasyllabic script whereby each character
    represents a syllable rather than one sound. Vowels and diphthongs are
    marked in two ways: as independent characters (used syllable-initially)
    and in an abbreviated form, to denote vowels after consonants. The
    romanization table is unambiguous but the user would have to recognize
    many ligatures not given in the original table. The system is mostly
    reversible but there exist some ambiguities in the romanization of
    vowels (independent vs. abbreviated characters) and consonants
    (ligatures vs. character sequences).

    Other systems of romanization

    For differences between the UN system and the ISO transliteration
    standard ISO 15919: 2001 see the section on the romanization of Hindi.

  notes:
    - |
      In the romanization system below character variations and the table of ligatures have been added.

      I. Independent vowel characters

      1	অ	a
      2	আ	ā
      3	ই	i
      4	ঈ	ī
      5	উ	u
      6	ঊ	ū
      7	ঋ	ṛ
      8	এ	e
      9	ঐ	ai
      10	ও	o
      11	ঔ	au




    - Where two Roman equivalents are given, the second (in brackets) is
      used for recording the pronunciation of place-names while the first
      form is for general use.
    - In the table only word-initial character variants are shown.
      Depending on the position in the word many variants of the characters
      are used as well as some ligatures. These features are not covered here.
    - For technical reasons the characters of the Mongolian script are
      turned 90˚ anti-clockwise.

    # Note: There are still couple of improvements we can do in the
    # transilation system, but for now this could work
    #
    # But please revisit this - specially the use case of `য়`, it's adding
    # some mixed character in the text.
