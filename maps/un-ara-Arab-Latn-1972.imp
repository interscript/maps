  description: |
    The United Nations recommended romanization
    system was approved in 1972 (resolution II/8),
    based on the system adopted by Arabic experts at
    the conference held at Beirut in 1971 with the
    practical amendments carried out and agreed upon
    by the representatives of the Arabic-speaking
    countries at their conference. The table was
    published in volume II of the conference report1
    . In the UN resolution it was specifically
    pointed out that the system was recommended "for
    the romanization of the geographical names within
    those Arabic-speaking countries where this system
    is officially acknowledged". It cannot be
    definitely ascertained which of the
    Arabicspeaking countries have adopted this system
    officially, especially since 2007 when there are
    efforts by the Arabic Division to promote a
    modification of the UN system (ADEGN
    romanization, see the section on other
    romanization systems below), with varying
    success2 . Judging by the use of names in
    international cartographic products which rely
    mostly on national sources it appears that the UN
    system or its modification is more or less
    current in Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Saudi Arabia3 ,
    United Arab Emirates and Yemen, there and in some
    other countries the system is often used without
    diacritical marks. For the geographical names of
    the Syrian Arab Republic international maps
    favour the UN system while the local usage seems
    to prefer a French-oriented romanization. Also in
    Egypt and Sudan there exist local romanization
    schemes or practices side by side with the UN
    system. The geographical names of Algeria,
    Djibouti, Mauritania, Morocco and Tunisia are
    generally rendered in the traditional manner
    which conforms to the principles of the French
    orthography. Resolution 7 of the Seventh UN
    Conference on the Standardization of Geographical
    Names (1998) recommended that "the League of Arab
    States should, through its specialized
    structures, continue its efforts to organize a
    conference with a view to considering the
    difficulties encountered in applying the amended
    Beirut system of 1972 for the romanization of
    Arabic script, and submit, as soon as possible, a
    solution to the United Nations Group of Experts
    on Geographical Names". At the Eighth UN
    Conference on the Standardization of Geographical
    Names (2002), the Arabic Division of the UN Group
    of Experts announced that it had finalised
    proposed modifications to the UN recommended
    romanization system. These proposals would be
    submitted to the League of Arab States for
    approval. Arabic is written from right to left.
    The Arabic script usually omits vowel points and
    diacritical marks from writing which makes it
    difficult to obtain uniform results in the
    romanization of Arabic. It is essential to
    identify correctly the words which appear in any
    particular name and to know the standard Arabic-
    script spelling including proper pointing. One
    must also take into account dialectal and
    idiosyncratic deviations. The romanization is
    generally reversible though there are some
    ambiguous letter sequences (dh, kh, sh, th) which
    may also point to combinations of Arabic
    characters in addition to the respective single
    characters.
  notes:
    - |
      The previous UN 1972 System had the following differences:
      the character (ظ) was romanized as z̧ instead of d͟h;
      ح, ص, ض the cedilla (¸) was used instead of sub-macron (_) in all characters with sub-macrons.  - |
      When the definite article al precedes a word beginning with one of the "sun letters" (t,
      th, d, dh, r, z, s, sh, ş, ḑ, ţ, z, l, n ̧ ) the l of the definite article is assimilated with the first
      consonant of the word: ash-Sh الشارقة āriqah.
