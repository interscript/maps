  description: |
    Pashto is an Indo-Iranian language and is one of two
    nationally official languages in Afghanistan and one of
    five regionally recognised languages in Pakistan. The
    romanization system presented here may be applied to all
    Pashto geographical names. Although the BGN/PCGN policy for
    geographical names in Afghanistan is to apply the BGN/PCGN
    national system of romanization for Afghanistan (2007),
    which incorporates Dari elements, when applied to a Pashto
    geographical name, the romanized results of the BGN/PCGN
    national system for Afghanistan are the same as those of
    this Pashto romanization system1 . The Pashto alphabet uses
    a modified form of the Perso-Arabic script, and contains
    twelve additional consonants not present in standard
    Arabic, as well as three additional vowel characters and an
    additional vowel point. ڼ گ ښ ژ ږ ړ ډ ځ څ چ ټ پ :Consonants
    ٙ :Point Vowel; ې ۍ ى :Vowels The points used in Arabic to
    mark short vowels and certain other diacritical marks are
    not written in Pashto. Consequently, a reference source may
    sometimes be required to aid correct identification of the
    standard spellings and proper vowels and elimination of
    dialectal and idiosyncratic variations. In the interests of
    clarity, a column showing vowel pointing from Arabic to
    indicate short vowels has been included in the examples
    below, alongside the unpointed form that will usually be
    encountered. However it should be noted that the
    pronunciation of short vowels will vary. (Note: it is
    recommended that a font such as Scheherazade, available
    from www.sil.org, which includes the Unicode extended
    Arabic sub-range, be used to view this system2 .)

  notes:
    - 1. Alif ( ‫ا‬ ) should be romanized as follows
      a. Initially,it indicates that the word begins with a vowel or
      diphthong; the alif itself is not romanized, but rather the
      short vowel it “carries” is romanized; e.g., Aslam Zhrandah
      ‫ه‬ َ‫د‬ ‫ن‬ ‫ژر‬ ‫سلَم‬ َ‫أ‬ ‫ميړ‬ → b. When it carries a
      maddah (‫)آ‬ (see vowel table, row 3), it represents ā;
      e.g., Band. Mīṟ ‫د‬ ‫ن‬ ‫ب‬ َ ‫آب‬ → Āb c. Medially and
      finally it represents ā (see table 2, row 2); e.g., ‫ۍ‬
      ‫ماڼ‬ → Māṉêy d. Medially and finally in words of Arabic
      origin, alif may serve as the bearer of hamzah, e.g.
      ‫رأس‬ → ra’s. See also note 4.

    - 2. The characters tsē ( ‫څ‬ ) and dzē ( ‫ځ‬ ) may be
      romanized t͡ s and d͡ z (the combining double breve (
      Unicode 0361) appearing over the digraph) when for special
      reasons it is desired that confusion be avoided between
      ‫ت‬ (t) plus ‫س‬ (s) and between ‫د‬ (d) plus ‫ز‬ (z),
      respectively.

    - 3. Occasionally the character sequences ‫ه‬ ‫ك‬ , ‫ه‬ ‫ز‬ ,
      ‫ه‬ ‫س‬ , and ‫ه‬ ‫گ‬ occur . They may be romanized k·h, z·
      h, s·h, and g·h in order to differentiate these
      romanizations from the digraphs kh, zh, sh, and gh, which
      are used to represent the characters ‫خ‬ , ‫ژ‬, ‫ش‬ , and
      ‫غ‬ respectively .

    - 4. Hamzah ( ‫ء‬ ) should be romanized as follows a. In
      word-initial position, where it will appear either above or
      below alif ( indicates a short vowel and should not itself
      be romanized. romanized by an apostrophe, e.g. ‫أ‬ or
      ‫إ‬ ), it In other positions it should be ‫جُزء‬ → juz’. b.
      Yeh with hamzah ( ‫ئ‬ ) should be romanized êy, unless it
      represents the compound (iẕāfah) morpheme, in which case it
      is romanized according to note 9 below.

    - 5. The division of words utilized in Pashto writing is
      followed in romanization, except that the elements –ābād, -
      khwā, -shahr, -zādah, -zay and -ullāh are always romanized
      as part of the preceding word, e.g. ‫آباد‬ ‫ت‬ ‫م‬ َ ْ‫ح‬
      ‫ر‬ َ → Raḩmatābād and ‫الله‬ ‫ت‬ ‫م‬ َ ْ‫ح‬ ‫ر‬ َ →
      Raḩmatullāh. However, when the word for God ( ‫الله‬ )
      appears as a standalone word it should be written Allāh.
      Note also the “dagger alif” ( ٙ) above the second ‫ل‬ (lām)
      in the word ‫الله‬ ; this, like the short vowels, is not
      written in Pashto but should be romanized ā, like a full-
      size alif. Persian derivational endings such as –vand and
      endings of Turkish origin such as –lar, -lī, -lū, -i, -u, -
      si, and –su, should be written together with the preceding
      word.

    - 6. The Pashto preposition ‫د‬ should be romanized dê in
      agreement with its pronunciation, despite the fact that
      it is sometimes pointed with kasrah ( ٙ ).

    - 7. In names of Arabic origin, the l of the definite article
      al/ul is assimilated before the ‘sun letters’ t, s̄ , d,
      z̄ , r, z, s, sh, ş, ẕ, ţ, z̧ , l and n. In romanization,
      the article will be written al or its assimilated
      equivalent in name-initial position but ul or its
      assimilated equivalent elsewhere; the article should be
      separated from the name it precedes and should not be
      capitalized, except at the beginning of a name, e.g. جَبَل
      السَرَاج → Jabal us Sarāj

    - 8. In Arabic names, a shaddah, ٙ is used to denote the
      doubling of a particular consonant character, e.g. ‫مَّد‬
      َ‫ح‬ ‫م‬ ُ → Muḩammad. However, in Pashto this ‘doubling’
      is frequently omitted in both Perso-Arabic script and the
      resulting romanization. Guidance on doubling may be taken
      from an authoritative names source, such as an Afghan
      government source or Pashto dictionary; for example, it is
      usual to see Ḩājī without and ‘Abbās with the doubled
      consonant. The doubled y consonant is almost always
      retained, as in Sayyid or Qayyūm

    - 9. The iẕāfah morpheme is not a grammatical feature of
      Pashto and, if encountered in a linguistically hybrid
      geographical name (i.e. combining features of both Pashto
      and Dari), it should be treated according to the BGN/PCGN
      national system of romanization for Afghanistan, 2007, as –
      e, unless the preceding word ends with a silent heh (‫)ه‬
      or a vowel when it should be shown – ye, e.g. 10. The
      character sequence ‫خو‬ , ‫صار‬ ‫ح‬ ِ ‫غر‬ → Ghar-e Ḩişār;
      ‫و‬ ‫ن‬ َ ‫ه‬ ٔ ‫لع‬ َ ‫ق‬ َ → when followed by ‫ا‬ or
      ‫ی‬ , Qal‘ah-ye Now.


    - 10. The character sequence خو when followed by ‫ا‬ or
      ‫ی‬ ,should be romanized khw, although the w is either not
      pronounced, or only weakly pronounced; e.g. ‫خواجه‬ →
      khwājah.

    - 11. An inventory of letter-diacritic combinations in addition to the unmodified letters of the
      basic Roman script is
