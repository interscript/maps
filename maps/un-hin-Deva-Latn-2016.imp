  description: |
    The United Nations recommended system was approved in 1972 (II/11) and amended in 1977
    (III/12), based on a report prepared by D. N. Sharma. The tables and their corrections were
    published in volume II of the conference reports.

    There is no evidence of the use of the system either in India or in international cartographic
    products. It was stated in 1987 that the appropriate resolution had not been implemented in
    India and the Hunterian system was still in use in large-scale mapping

    Hindi uses the alphasyllabic script Devanāgarī whereby each character represents a syllable
    rather than one sound. Vowels and diphthongs are marked in two ways: as independent
    characters (used syllable-initially) and in an abbreviated form, to denote vowels after
    consonants. The romanization table is unambiguous but the user would have to recognize
    many ligatures not given in the original table (only three are given). The system is mostly
    reversible but there may exist some ambiguities in the romanization of vowels (independent
    vs. abbreviated characters) and consonants

  notes:
    - |
      It is recommended that the vowel अ (a) should always be romanized except when it ends a
      name. If a name ends with a consonant, the consonant should carry a sub-macron. Such
      cases, however, will be very rare. For example, कानपुर Kānapur (not Kānapura), जगत्
      Jagat.
    - |
      If each letter of a digraph or any two parts of a trigraph has a distinct independent sound
      then it should be indicated by a hyphen, thus d-h.

    ######################################## Additional Note ############################################################
    #    It is recommended that the vowel अ (a) should always be romanized except when it ends a                        #
    #    name. In the scheme we are not yet able to detect a name. Analysing language pattern and the example           #
    #    we found that actually when a word ends with a consonant it should be transliterated without the vowel in it.  #
    #    so we are applying this rule as if a word ends with a consonant, in this case we are removing the ending 'a'.  #
